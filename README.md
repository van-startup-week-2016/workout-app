# DropDown

A mobile-friendly web application that helps you workout! It sends you texts
every once in a while (you decide how long) when you are available (you decide
when) with some exercises! When finished just send a text back saying "yes" or
"yay!" or "bananas". It must be one of those three.

 Quick 30 second workouts throughout the day can be un onabtrusive way to stay
 in shape!
